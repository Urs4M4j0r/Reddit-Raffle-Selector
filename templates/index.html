							<p>This application was designed to facilitate increased fairness in Reddit comment based raffles.</p>

									<h3>How does it work?</h3>
									<p>It works by pulling the name of every commentor on a particular post into a list and then using a random number generator selects one username from that list to return as the winner.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-hammer"></span>
									<h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
									<p>I have thought about doing a raffle style Reddit post before but decided against it as I was concerned about how to fairly and impartially select a winner without unconciously giving a leg up to the popular comments.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-users"></span>
									<h3>What if I comment on the raffle thread more than once? Will this program give me two entries?</h3>
									<p>No, this program will only add each username once, ensuring no duplicate entries.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-blender"></span>
									<h3>How can I be sure it is actually random?</h3>
									<p>If you would like to test it for yourself feel free to run the application against any reddit thread more than once and see that each time a different username is returned. (assuming the thread you choose has a sufficient number of comments.)</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-coins"></span>
									<h3>Is this free to use?</h3>
									<p>Yes, this is completely free to use.</p>

									<h3>This website looks good! How did you make it?</h3>
									<p>I wish I could say I was talented enough at web development to have created this website in it's entirety. This website is based on a free template from <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a> which I have modified to suit my purpose. However, the backend programming which performs the raffle winner selection was created by scratch by myself.</p>
